# BookReader

As an experiment, I decided to read a set of freely available books as slow and as fast as possible.

The SortedList, SortedDictionary (binary tree), and Dictionary (hash table) were compared.
For fun, the most naive method (linear search on an unordered list) was also implemented.


RESULTS:

As one would expect, linear search is awful. 

It took about 1.36 seconds for the hash table and 788.35 seconds for the unorderd list to index a novel with 52,071 words on my not so fast computer. A trial was taken 15 times to obtain these averages.
